            <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
            <p>Like the technical community as a whole, the Full Stack Belgium team and community is made up of a mixture of
                professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including
                mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.</p>
            <p>Diversity is one of our strengths. With that, challenges will arise that can lead to communication issues
                and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code
                applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.</p>
            <p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s
                intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we
                participate.</p>
            <p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces used by the Full Stack Belgium community for communication. This includes
                Full Stack Belgium Slack, GitHub, Twitter, our Events, conferences, and any other
                relevant forums. Violations of this code outside of any spaces managed by the Full Stack Belgium team will still
                affect a person’s ability to participate within them.</p>
            <p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing <a
                    href="mailto:dries.vints@gmail.com">dries.vints@gmail.com</a>. We take all reports seriously, and your
                identity will remain confidential.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of
                        all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race,
                        ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class,
                        educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family
                        status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will
                        depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you
                        should take those consequences into account when making decisions.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no
                        excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and
                        then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to
                        remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
                        Members of the Full Stack Belgium community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as
                        with people outside the Full Stack Belgium community.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of professionals,
                        and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
                        participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior isn’t acceptable. This includes, but
                        is not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
                        <li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
                        <li>Exclusionary gendered language (guys, gentlemen, bros, etc).</li>
                        <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
                        <li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information
                            ("doxing").
                        </li>
                        <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
                        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
                        <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
                        <li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social and
                        technical, happen all the time and Full Stack Belgium is no exception. It is important that we resolve
                        disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of
                        Full Stack Belgium comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people
                        have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint
                        doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other
                        doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
